2) **Remotely Connecting**
- We must connect to our CSE-specific account that we will utilize for the time duration of the course, to start one must open the VS Code terminal (CTRL + ') and on it type the secure shell command and our account name. 

```
#Secure Shell Command
"ssh " + "cs15lsp22"+ YOUR specific course letters + "@ieng6.ucsd.edu"'
```

- Answer yes to the initiation messages you are given by the computer and type out your password when prompted by the server computer to do so.
